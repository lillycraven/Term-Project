# The Big Idea
We want to do an Amazon purchase tracker to calculate how much the user spends. We will download the data from our personal amazon accounts, and make it into a CSV.  We will use the pandas package to help actually analyze the data, we then will clean the data, calculate sales tax etc. This will be our minimum viable product and our stretch goal will consist of diving further into budgeting, possibly showing what categories the user needs to cut back on based on their highest spend categories, or expanding and allowing the user to input their order history of any store for us to track it. We are also considering adding a feature that lets you know about a specific amazon product when it goes on discount. While neither of us are finance concentrations, we are both interested in personal finances and think this project would help us learn more and be useful to us in our day to day life. Since we have a lot of interests in this topic, we hope to be able to achieve the stretch goals we set.

# Learning Objectives -->
We are both Business Analytics concentrations, so this will give us a good opportunity to integrate our new knowledge of python, with a project that allows us to practice analyzing data and hopefully pulling out useful conclusions. We also want to become more comfortable with taking data from our day to day lives and utilizing python to find out how to best utilize it.

# Implementation Plan
We have a pretty good idea of our first steps, as outlined in our “big idea” section. We are utilizing dataquest.io (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-much-spent-amazon-data-analysis/) to help us with the basis of our project. Once this is completed we will tackle our stretch goals, while we want to give ourselves room to explore what sticks out to us as most interesting, most likely this will start with exploring how to implement order and purchase history from other sites into our project. Again after this we want to give ourselves the chance to explore what is most interesting, but we plan on looking at how we can organize and utilize the data we found from the first steps of our project, this might look like a program that states what categories we need to cut down on, or an interactive budget planner that allows users to input how much they want to spend (potentially per category) and we can give recommendations of how they can stay within their budget.

# Project Schedule

# Collaboration Plan
We plan to work on step one of the implementation plan/the first part of the project together in order to make sure that both of us have a good understanding of what will make up the basis of our project. This is what we did for Homework 3 and we found that it was successful.  After the initial stage of our project, we will have to decide a more concrete plan of how we plan to accomplish stretch goals, we imagine that this will consist of both of us experimenting with how to amplify the project on our own and coming together to share what we have learned and integrate both of our ideas into the final version. We feel as though this structure will most benefit the way we both work and worked out fairly well for us when looking at Project 3. 

# Risks and Limitations  
One potential risk we run into is since the basis of our project has already been done it may become boring/oversimplified so we will have to make sure we can add things to it that still make it unique and useful. We also want to make sure that we don't bite off more than we can chew and keep our goals realistic throughout the project, so we don't get carried away and then are unable to complete it.

# Additional Course Content 
Some topics that will be helpful to our project is web/data scraping as well as data visualization like matplotlib. Using web scraping will help us access hidden data and specific attributes such as date and time for amazon orders. I also believe we might utilize lists and dictionaries to store data as well as some sqlite and Flask to save and showcase our findings.
